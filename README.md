# Repeat

Nothing special. I spent some time googling to find a tool like `yes` that infinitely
printed without the newlines. After spending more time looking than it'd take just to
write my own, I decided to write my own. Maybe I overlooked something obvious, but this
fits my needs for now.

```
Usage of repeat:
  -buffer int
    	the minimum size in bytes of the repeated output (default 4096)
  -byte
    	if set, the program will interpret the args as a sequence of numerical bytes to repeat
```
